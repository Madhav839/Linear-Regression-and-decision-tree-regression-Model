This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices using regression algorithms. It compares the performance of Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor based on evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
âœ… Workflow
Data Loading
Load the dataset using pandas.

Data Preprocessing

Remove or encode non-numeric columns.

Handle missing values (if any).

Split data into features (X) and target (y).

Train-Test Split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test created using train_test_split.

Modeling

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regression

Evaluation Metrics

MAE: Mean Absolute Error

MSE: Mean Squared Error

RMSE: Root Mean Squared Error
